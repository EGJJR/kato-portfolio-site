This theme/template is designed and crafted by [me](https://www.eddjosephjr.com).
NB: Additional color themes can also be configured on the `src/data/theme.ts` file.

## 🥷 Usage

- You can modify all the information in the files in the `data` folder (presentation, social links, projects list, colors).
- You can write articles in `markdown` format in the `content/posts` folder.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
