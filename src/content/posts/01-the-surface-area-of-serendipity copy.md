In 1755, a devastating hurricane struck the Caribbean island of St. Croix. In its aftermath, a
young, orphaned clerk wrote such a vivid description of the disaster that local businessmen took
notice, pooled their resources, and sent him to America for an education. That clerk was
Alexander Hamilton, and his rise from obscurity to founding father tells of a powerful truth:
what we call "luck" is often the moment preparation meets visibility.
Hamilton's story isn't unique in its pattern, though it may be in its scale. History and modern
times alike are filled with moments where talent meets opportunity, creating what we often
dismiss as mere "luck." Closer examination tells us that every “overnight success” depends on
two variables we can actually control: what we can do, and who knows we can do it.

### The Start is Not the End

Everyone starts their lives with a predetermined area of serendipity. It is shaped by different
elements like our socioeconomic background, geographic location, family connections, and
access to education. The size of our individual areas may differ, but it does not determine final
outcomes. As we previously explored, Alexander Hamilton was orphaned while young.
Benjamin Franklin himself started out as the son of a candle and soap maker as the eight of ten
children whose formal education ended at 10 years old. Marie Sklodowska (later known as Marie
Curie), was born in soviet Poland, lost her mother and sister by age 10, saw her father lose her
job, and was denied higher education due to her gender. Each of these historical figures started
out with very limited areas of serendipity. Disregarding that fact, they all came to become figures
we all studied in our childhood.

### Skill

The first dimension of your area is skill. Developing your skills is one of the surest ways of
coming across opportunities. Many of the examples already explored acquired skills through
inordinate amounts of effort. Alexander Hamilton arrived at King's College (now Columbia)
having, through determination, already mastered commerce, accounting, and classical languages.
At every stage of his life, when a new opportunity presented itself, he made sure to acquire as
many skills and as much knowledge of the topic. He wasn't an isolated case. Benjamin Franklin
intentionally learned everything from meteorology to diplomacy. Marie Curie mastered advanced
mathematics in secret through Warsaw's underground education system before revolutionizing
physics. We conclude that skill acquisition leads to exceptional achievement and that every skill
we acquire expands the realm of possible futures available to us.

### Visibility

Now, would Alexander Hamilton have gone to the U.S without the local businessmen’s
knowledge of his skill and existence? Would Benjamin Franklin have been appointed as
Pennsylvania’s agent to London if it weren’t for his Junto Club connections and widespread
reputation? Would Marie Curie have gotten the opportunity to go to France’s Sorbonne without
the help of her reputation she built during her underground studies? By answering these
questions, we understand that though they were incredibly skilled, without visibility, they would
not have had access to the opportunities they are so known for today. Therefore, visibility acts as
a multiplier of opportunities.

### Your Surface Area

At this stage, we have learned a few things:

> 1. Skills creates preparedness
> 2. Visibility produces opportunities
> 3. Success in either dimension amplifies the other

This helps us understand that growing skill and visibility has a multiplier effect that compounds
on itself. This interaction creates a virtuous cycle: visible skills attract a network that presents
opportunities, through which you gain new skills, build a larger network, and access even greater
opportunities. Each new addition doesn’t add value but multiplies the value of every skill,
connection, and platform you've already built. This is how humble beginnings can turn into
extraordinary biographies.
