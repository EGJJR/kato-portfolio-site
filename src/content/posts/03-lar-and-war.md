Networking is the art and science of building interconnected meaningful relationships. Here, we will
cover the science aspect of it.

###

The architecture of computer networks is a great analogy for understanding human relationships.
With it, we can understand the nature of our social connections, how they function at diﬀerent
levels, and the intentionality—or lack thereof—behind the act of networking and its natural
progression when cultivated eﬀectively.

### The Architecture of Networks

Local Area Networks (LANs) are the most immediate and contained form of computer connectivity.
They are typically confined to specific geographical areas, such as buildings and campuses and are
known for their high-speed and more direct communication between devices. Their controlled
environment enables faster data transfer, enhanced security, and better maintenance. Wide Area
Networks (WANs) cover large geographical areas, connecting multiple LANs across great distances,
but have higher latency and complex routing protocols.

### Local Area Relationships (LARs)

Our immediate circles, much like LANs, are comprised of relationships in our close geographical
area such as family members, workplace colleagues, interest clubs, and local industry groups. They
are inherently self-sustaining because their members are bound by a mutual anchor point, ensuring
regular interaction and the potential for collaboration. The “bandwidth” of these relationships is
high—conversations happen organically, resources are shared quickly, and collaborations occur with
little friction.

### Wide Area Relationships (WARs)

Beyond our immediate circles, we find relationships that classify as WARs. They include family
members in diﬀerent continents, LinkedIn connections, conference acquaintances, and industry
peers. Similarly to computer WANs, these relationships oﬀer valuable breadth and diversity but
demand more intentional maintenance and, sometimes, formal protocols for engagement. This often
happens in the form of periodic check-ins, scheduled video calls, and yearly conference attendance.
Latency is naturally higher because communication is less frequent and more structured. However,
they provide access to more perspectives and opportunities than our immediate circles can oﬀer.

### The Network Eﬀect

Brought together, the two create a powerful network eﬀect: the presence of more LARs creates the
opportunity for more WARs. These, in turn, feed back into the original network, increasing its
density and reach. A well-functioning network is not static; it evolves by weaving LARs and WARs
into a complex yet harmonious system of interconnected relationships.

###

For example, consider a workplace circle built around shared professional objectives. Within this
LAR, individuals will connect with other professionals through conferences or joint ventures and
create WARs. These interactions not only bring external knowledge and opportunities into the LAR
but also create new WARs within external networks, creating an ever-expanding ecosystem of
connections.
